### Motivation

During the 2020 year we are planning to start creating a human-like full scale robot based on an open source solution. For this activity we are going to make a team 5-15 (probably growing) people extending the robot bit by bit. The activity is supposed to gather people intrested in robotics and have hands-on group experience in creating a robot from scratch.
